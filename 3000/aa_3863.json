On comparison with the Mantinea base (<rs type=\"sculpture\">Athens, NM 215</rs>-217; cf. <bibl n=\"Paus. 8.90\">Paus. 8.90</bibl>), however, it is most likely the relief portion of a statue base, too tall for decree or votive relief.  Further, as mentioned by Budde/Nicholls (18) \"...it is clear that the figure with the garland stood in comparative isolation, strongly suggesting the kind of widely spaced composition favored for the decoration of monumental bases.</P><P>As the findspot is unknown, this work has not been considered in the corpus of Athenian fourth century works.  Budde and Nicholls compared it to a work from a Theban workshop (a votive relief, <rs type=\"sculpture\">Athens, NM 1140</rs>; <bibl>Svoronos 1903-12, 440, pl. 72</bibl>).
