          "<P>The neck and shoulder are decorated with bands of lotus and\n      palmette. Above the shoulder decoration is another band of alternating red and black tongues.\n      The main panel is bordered below the groundline by buds and tendrils interspersed with dots.\n      Beneath this pattern are flamelike tongues that extend down to the body-base join. The base,\n      handles and rim are black. Below the handle joins are large palmette, bud, and spiral\n      patterns.</P><P>On side A, Theseus is fighting the Minotaur in the center, while a\n      youth and a girl look on from either side. Theseus is naked, with a headband and a strap over\n      his right shoulder, presumably to hold his scabbard. With his left hand he grasps the sinking\n      Minotaur, and with his right hand he brandishes his sword. The Minotaur has fallen to his left\n      knee. He holds stones in both hands, the right raised to throw. Blood flows from his upper\n      right arm where the sword has wounded him. The two maidens, whose skin is white, each wear\n      ankle-length, shortsleeved chitons. The lefthand one's garment is mostly black on top, with\n      red sleeves and underarms, with a skirt that is red to the knees, where it is decorated by\n      white lines and dots, and then continues to the ankles in black. The righthand figure's chiton\n      has vertical red and black stripes above and below. The shirt hem is decorated with white\n      dots, as is the hem of the long skirt. Both maidens have red headbands. The youths who stand\n      to the far left and far right, are both naked. The youth on the left has a red headband, while\n      the righthand youth has red hair.</P><P>On side B, two armed warriors duel with\n      spears in the center, while a woman and man look on. The lefthand warrior is wearing a short\n      red chiton with white dots on the hem, a cuirass, a greave on his left leg, a white strap over\n      his right shoulder from which his sword scabbard is suspended, a masked, low-crested helmet.\n      In his right hand he wields his spear; in his left is a round shield visible from its\n      interior. The righthand warrior is dressed similarly to his opponent, without a cuirass, and\n      with a high crest on his helmet instead of a low crest. With his opposite pose, this warrior's\n      shield device is fully visible, four white and three red balls. The male onlooker on the far\n      left has an ankle-length garment striped diagonally in broad red and black stripes. Its hem is\n      dotted in white. The woman on the far right wears a shortsleeved, ankle-length chiton, the\n      skirt red with a wavy white line decorating the hem. The blouse is covered with vertical black\n      and red stripes, and dotted in white at its hem. The woman also has a red headband. In her\n      right she holds a wreath. There is an ambiguous inscription in the field behind the warriors'\n      legs.</P>"
