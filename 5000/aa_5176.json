          "<P>The interior, handle, and lower portion of the bowl exterior\n      are black. The outside of the rim has an unusual embattlement pattern with five small dots in\n      the intervals, done in black on white ground between fine lines.</P><P>Large eyes\n      separate the central figure from those at the handles. The eyes, though incompletely\n      preserved, are relatively small and elongated, with the outer corners pointing upward and\n      long, curving tear ducts. The strongly curved outlines of the eyes are executed in white\n      paint, added over the white ground. The outer ring of the eye is red, while the next, equal in\n      size is painted white. Probably there was a central black area with a small red\n      pupil.</P><P>The cocks, while not completely preserved, are rendered in great\n      detail. The eye and beak are incised, while comb and wattle are in added red, with carefully\n      depicted points and blade of the comb. The throat has a strong convex curve, while the hackle\n      bears white dots, its lower feathers indicated in incised points. Each wing feather has an\n      incised outline and a dot of red paint. The long flight feathers probably appeared in two\n      layers, set apart by a scalloped line of incision with added white paint. Four or five long\n      saddle feathers were incised in outline, while two long sickle feathers were painted black.\n      The tail feathers are rendered similarly to the flight feathers, with the same scalloped\n      incision. The color of the two cocks' tail feathers differs; every other feather on the\n      lefthand cock is red, those of the righthand cock white. Each cock faces the\n      handle.</P><P>The komast in the center of the scene has an unusual costume that\n      covers much of his body. The remaining parts are rendered in little anatomical detail. His\n      head appears too large for his body, partly because of the mitra wrapped around it, and partly\n      because of his extensive projecting hair and beard growth. The hair and beard are painted red.\n      The komast's eye is large, low, and carefully incised, and his nose is straight. His\n      short-sleeved chitoniskos has buttonholes drawn, but no buttons. Its collar is white, and its\n      hem is dotted white. The skirt folds are broadly spaced, curvy incised lines. His boots are\n      red, laced around the ankles and given prominent tongues. His upper and lower limbs have few\n      details except the open incised loop of the kneecap. He is holding in both hands a lyre with\n      swan-head terminals.</P><P>The face and neck of the molded female on the kyathos\n      handle are painted white. A red band with white dots holds her long, red brown, wavy hair away\n      from her face. Three tresses hang behind each ear, and her curly bangs are shown by a single\n      row of raised dots. Her eyes and eyebrows have the same color as her hair. Her lips are\n      undefined.</P>"
