          "<P>Dionysos is at center, facing left and sitting on his mantle.\n      His thyrsos rests on his right and he holds the arm of Ariadne with his left hand. With his\n      right he seems to be drawing her head down to his, but much of this area is lost. He has\n      luxuriant long curls barely confined in a wreath and wears the exotic dress of an easterner,\n      including anaxyrides (trousers), high boots, and jerkin. On top of the jerkin he wears the\n      nebris or animal hide of his cult. They are clearly embracing as she stands with her right arm\n      round his neck and her left at his waist. She has her wreathed hair long and wears a long girt\n      Doric chiton over her himation. On the left, facing Dionysos, a Maenad sits, looking on and\n      resting her left arm on a large tympanon decorated with a central star and edged with dotted\n      lozenges. (This recalls a well-known motif of Nike with the shield.) She wears earrings, a\n      long girt transparent chiton which has slipped off her shoulders, and a himation around her\n      waist. Her curly hair is drawn up with a checkered sphendone. A languid Eros stands on top of\n      her tympanon, facing center. He is shown nude as a full-grown boy, with short wavy hair bound\n      by a fillet. He seems to be fanning the god with a palmette shaped fan which he holds in his\n      left hand. Behind these figures stands the nude god Pan, facing center as he plays the syrinx,\n      holding it with both hands. Standing on higher ground, beside the side handle, he leans\n      forward into the scene. He is identified by his pipes, and his goat-like horns, ears, and\n      tail. The himation draped over his left shoulder seems like an afterthought. At the far left\n      above the side handle is Aegipan, with goat's legs and ears. Facing left, he dances in a\n      contorted way, bending over to fill his oinochoe with wine from the pithos below. The figure\n      overlaps considerably the palmette ornament. To the left, behind Ariadne and on higher ground,\n      stands a semi-nude Maenad. She dances to the right, looking center and beating on her\n      tympanon, decorated with a central star and edged with a wave pattern. Her hair is rolled up\n      in a chignon and braided, bound up with a diadem. She is clothed with earrings, a necklace of\n      beads, and shoes. Her very loosely draped himation has slid to her waist. Behind her to the\n      right, a bearded satyr sits in a three-quarter view, facing center. He has very rough hair\n      wreathed in ivy, goat's ears, and a mantle a round his waist. He plays a magadis (triangular\n      harp) to serenade the gathering. Above the right side handle crouches the diminutive winged\n      figure of Echo, almost completely obscured by a voluminous mantle. She looks down on the\n      central scene with her wings spread, as if about to take\n      flight.</P><P></P><P>On the lower part of the outer curve of the rim\n      there is an egg pattern. At the base of the neck there is a gilded, upward curving necklace of\n      pendants. Below the main design, which occupies the shoulder and the body, there is a frieze\n      of four meanders separated by checker square. At the base of each side handle is a reserved\n      band. Below each side handle is a single fifteen-leafed palmette with spiraliform tendrils and\n      dotted shoots. At the back there is an elaborate scrolling pattern composed of six\n      seventeen-leafed palmettes with dotted circle centers and dizzying running spirals. Around the\n      outer curve of the foot is a reserved band.</P>"
