          "<P>A seated (?) figure, perhaps Dionysos (only part of left arm\n      [?] and diagonal thyrsos, remaining); Demeter, seated 3/4-view to the left on a cista (?),\n      with her head profile to the right, wearing a peplos belted high over a long overfold, with\n      two vertical striations (relief) down the front of her garment, a himation draped over her\n      lower body, a polos with vegetal ornament, pendant earrings, a single band necklace with a\n      central pendant, a beaded bracelet on her right hand, and a band bracelet on her left hand,\n      leans her bent left arm on the back of her seat (the back is not visible), and holds a scepter\n      in her upraised right hand; three stalks of grain; a white, nude boy, Ploutos, standing\n      3/4-view to the right, with his head turned 3/4-view to the left, and his weight on his left\n      leg, with his right leg relaxed, wearing a grain crown, with a colored (or white?) himation,\n      draped over his bent left arm, holds in both hands, slightly to the right, a gold keras filled\n      with grain stalks; a white female figure, probably Kore (only right body preserved), standing\n      near frontal, with her weight on her left leg, and her right leg relaxed, wearing a white (?),\n      patterned himation with gilded relief border, probably over a chiton, and a band on her right\n      wrist, bends her right arm above Ploutos.</P><P>According to Clinton (50) this\n      Ploutos is a perfect parallel to the boy on the Great Eleusinian relief (<rs\n      type=\"sculpture\">Athens, NM 126</rs>), except for the keras, which, \"... however, ..\n      is not an essential attribute of Eleusinian Ploutos. The crucial element is the display of\n      grain.\" In this painted representation, however, we can be more confident that Ploutos rather\n      than Triptolemos is intended."
