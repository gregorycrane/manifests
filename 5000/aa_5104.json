          "<P>The neck and body are white ground. The echinus mouth is\n      reserved on the topside. The inside of the mouth is glazed to the neck-shoulder join. The\n      triple handles are glazed on the outside and reserved on the inside. On the neck, on each side\n      are three open palmettes, the outer two upright, the middle one hanging, all linked by\n      tendrils and bordered above and below by a glaze line. There is a ridge at the join of the\n      neck and shoulder. On the shoulder are enclosed tongues. Below each handle is a configuration\n      of four palmettes and one large hanging lotus bud, with two small horizontal buds where the\n      tendrils meet and a bar crossing the tendril that springs from the lower handle attachment.\n      Below the figures is a pair of glazed lines above and below a right-facing key pattern, a band\n      of upright open lotus buds and a pair of glazed lines. Above the foot are thirty-nine rays. At\n      the body-foot join is a red fillet. The torus foot is in two degrees, with the division\n      reserved. The lower part of the foot edge and the underside of the foot are\n      reserved.</P><P>On side A, the scene depicts a duel. A warrior advancing to the\n      right is attacking another, who falls to his knees to the right and looks back at his\n      opponent. Both warriors are wearing cuirass, short chiton, greaves, and crossed baldrics from\n      which scabbards are suspended. Only their helmets and shields are different. The victor wears\n      a low-crested Corinthian helmet, and his shield is Boeotian. The falling warrior wears a\n      high-crested Corinthian helmet and carries a round shield.</P><P>On side B, a\n      similar duel is shown, but the combat direction is opposite to that on side A. Also, on side B\n      the hoplites' scabbards hang from a single baldric instead of two. The victor's shield has an\n      incised rosette for a device.</P><P>Red is used for the base fillet, on side A for\n      the lefthand warrior's helmet crest, baldrics, the edge of his shield's rim's notched\n      portions, his short chiton and right greave, the righthand warrior's helmet, shield edge,\n      baldrics, the stripes on his short chiton, and his left greave, on side B the lefthand\n      warrior's helmet crest edge, shield rim, the stripes of his short chiton, his left greave, and\n      the righthand warrior's helmet fillet, baldric, the edge of his shield rim's notched portions,\n      the stripes on his short chiton, and his right greave.</P>"
