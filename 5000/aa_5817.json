He wears calf-length boots, a\n      chlamys bucked in front, and a petasos. A kerykeion lies on the ground behind his right\n      foot."

          "Beazley notes that this plate may have the same story shown on <rs\n      type=\"vase\">St. Petersburg St. 1792</rs>. It is impossible to determine how much of\n      the drawing reflects restoration and/or artist's embellishments, as the vase is now lost. If\n      the attributes are all authentic, then the identity of Hermes (with boots, chlamys, petasos,\n      and kerykeion) is secure. As Dionysos is the baby who was traditionally handed to Hermes, and\n      this baby is shown with nebris and ivy leaves, as befits Dionysos, it is most likely that he,\n      not Ploutos, is here represented. Although she does not emerge from the ground, according to\n      the drawing), the female figure is closer to the image of Ge (particularly on <rs\n      type=\"vase\">Naples H 2883</rs>, <rs type=\"vase\">Istanbul 2576</rs> and\n      <rs type=\"vase\">St. Petersburg St. 1792</rs>) than the nymphs, who traditionally\n      receive Dionysos, on account of her attire and hair."
