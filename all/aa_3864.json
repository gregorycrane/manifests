          "<P>Single youth, dancing profile to the right, with his weight on both legs, slightly bent, with his left leg slightly advanced, completely enveloped in a himation, draped over his left shoulder, obscuring his bent, slightly raised, right arm, and his slightly lowered left hand, wearing a taenia in short hair; two groups of  three similar figures, the second group adjacent to a nearly frontal female figure (slightly to the right), with her head turned 3/4-view to the left, her weight on her left leg, and her right leg relaxed; she wears a long-sleeved chiton, a himation draped over her left shoulder and around her torso, falling back over her bent left arm, and holds her right hand at her side; a female figure (taller/slimmer than first), standing 3/4-view to the right, with her weight on her left leg, right leg relaxed, wearing a sleeved chiton and a himation draped over left shoulder, wrapped around her body, and falling back over her left arm; eight nude youths, in two groups of four, dancing 3/4-view to the right, each with his weight on his right foot (on tip-toe), with his bent left leg pulled behind it, wearing a small (Attic) helmet, holds his slightly bent right arm, with clenched fist, at his side, and holds sharply foreshortened round shield on outstretched left arm; the shield of each youth except, of course, the first dancer in each group overlaps his predecessor by a different degree.</P><P>The pyrrhic dance, one of the earliest contests in the Panathenaia (<bibl n=\"Lys. 24.4\">Lys. 24.4</bibl>, <bibl n=\"Isaeus 5.36\">Isaeus 5.36</bibl>) is portrayed on the right block, as indicated by the inscription, as well as the pose and attire of the dancers.  The figures on the left are harder to identify, and Kosmopoulou (1997) has suggested that they are participants in the dithyramb, a tribal contest (<hi rend=\"ital\">IG</hi> 2.2, 3157) first instituted in Athens as a tribal event at Great Dionysia in 509/508, as the inscription seems to refer to <Foreign lang=Greek> *K*U*K*L*I*W*S *X*O*R*W*S</Foreign>a characteristic of the dithyramb.  She has further proposed that the lone figure at the left is probably the chorus leader, which is far more plausible than that the female figures, previously identified as male figures, represented choregoi.  She then identifies the female figures a Phylai, personifications of the tribes themselves.  Although this hypothesis is conjectural at best, it is tempting, as the regal female figures (shown at a slightly larger scale than the male participants), must be personifications, if not goddesses.  There are two present, rather than only one, as the base seems to celebrate two of Atarbos' victories.  Kosmopoulou accordingly suggests that the right block was dedicated first, and later joined by the left block.  This proposal explains the discrepancy between the two in relief style, inscriptions, and the placement of the figures atop (where the three [bronze] figures are all shifted somewhat to the right)."
