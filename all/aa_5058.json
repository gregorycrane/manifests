          "<P>The edge of the foot is clay-colored, while its top is glazed\n      with a red edge and a red stripe in the center. The body-foot join is painted red. The strap\n      handles are glazed on top and bottom, decorated laterally with rosettes, and their upper edges\n      bearing a red stripe. A delicate red bulge appears at the neck attachment. The neck is glazed\n      on its exterior and interior, while the rim itself is decorated outside and inside with red\n      stripes. There are two more red stripes on the neck interior. On the lower body of the vessel\n      is a glazed zone bordered above and below by red stripes. In this area on both sides are the\n      scenes, interrupted at the shoulder by a band of rosettes with red dots in the center. A band\n      of red and black tongues borders the shoulder scenes at the body-neck join. The main scene on\n      side A is bordered laterally by ivy leaves, on side B by diagonal zigzag marks. On both sides\n      of the neck is a chain of opposed lotuses and palmettes, elaborately rendered, with red center\n      leaves on the lotuses. The upper half of the decoration is repeated at the\n      rim.</P><P>On side A, a bearded man beckons favor of a youth, while bearded men\n      dance on either side of them. All four figures are naked. The youth holds a wreath with white\n      dots on its edge in his left hand, and with his right he clasps the left hand of the man who\n      is courting him. Both center figures, as well as the dancer on the left, wear white chain\n      necklaces. The lefthand dancer hops on his right leg with lively upraised left leg and left\n      arm, while the right arm punches the air behind him. The righthand dancer is in the midst of a\n      leap, with both feet off the ground. Over his left shoulder, presumably as a love gift, he\n      carries a deer with red throat and white belly stripes. All four figures have red hair, and\n      the two on the left have red beards. In the background are nonsense\n      inscriptions.</P><P>On side B a frontal chariot is depicted, with a bird flying to\n      the left above the two horses on the right. Red is used for the four horses' breast bands, as\n      well as the three lefthand horses' manes, two stripes on the chariot, the charioteer's throat,\n      and two wing stripes on the bird. The horses' breast bands were decorated with rows of white\n      dots. The two horses on the outsides have their forelocks tied into a\n      tuft.</P><P>Both shoulder scenes depict two wrestlers flanked by two onlookers.\n      Here the drawing is noticeably more careless than in the main scenes. On both sides the\n      lefthand wrestler has his opponent locked in a firm grip. The spectators all lean on staffs,\n      although the staff of the lefthand spectator on side A is so thinly painted that it is hardly\n      visible. All are holding mantles over one arm. Both wrestlers on side B and the righthand\n      wrestler on side A are bearded. All beard and head hair is red. Both mantles on side A and the\n      lefthand mantle on side B are striped in red, while the righthand mantle on side B is dotted\n      in red. Above each righthand wrestler a garment is hanging at the upper edge of the\n      scenes.</P>"
