It is likely that the unknown male figure and this conjectured female figure are personifications (Boule and Demos), for Demos at least is shown on a scale intermediate between Athena and the honorand.  Schne (<bibl>Schne 1872, 44</bibl>) made the unlikely suggestion that the honorand was also a personification.  <bibl>Walter 1923, 15</bibl> originally suggested that the honorand was a priestess of Athena Polias or an arrephora, and that the male figure was a phyle hero.  Honorary decrees for women are unusual; see <bibl>Lawton 1995, no. 164</bibl>=<hi rend=\"ital\">IG</hi> 2.2, 776."
