He was killed before the reaffirmation of the decree, but it was necessary (because of the intervening oligarchy of 323/22) so that his son could receive his same honors.

Holes for metal attributes are apparent, e.g., reins reaching from the holes on the horses muzzle to the lower right hip, for which reason it is likely that the (missing) crown was also metal.<P>As Lawton notes (108) the bearded male figure, often identified as Zeus Soter, must be Demos, because he is slightly smaller than Athena, although larger than the honorand, and because Demos would be an appropriate representative of the democracies Euphron had represented.</P>"
