          "The identity of the male figure is debated.  Lawton (82) discusses the age of the young male character, as an iconographic clue, which compares to that of the nude youth, traditionally identified as Triptolemos, on the Great Eleusinian Relief (<rs type=\"sculpture\">Athens, NM 126</rs>).  In light of Clinton's reidentification of the youth on this relief as Ploutos, the comparison to Triptolemos is not so clear.  Although it would be difficult to identify this unbearded, youthful character as the Demos of Athens, who is normally shown as a mature, venerable man, it is yet conceivable that the Eleusinian Demos is here represented, as he might have been perceived as a younger, less mature entity than the Athenian Demos."
