          "<P>Female head, broken at the neck. The head is set at a strong angle on the neck, turned toward the proper right side of the figure. The ripple of the Venus rings on the neck accentuate the turn. The outline of the face is full. The eyes are widely set. The nose, mouth and chin are heavily restored. The face is surrounded by a mass of loose curls. In the back the hair is brushed up off the neck and held in place by a diadem, whose position is clearly indicated by the carving. Holes for the attachment of metal are located along its line, as well as on both ear lobes.</P><P>The head has long been attributed to the Parthenon pediments on the basis of style as well as scale. The attribution has been almost universally accepted, although the question of which particular figure or even which pediment is represented has not been determined. Brommer gives a summary of the bibliography and various hypotheses up to 1963 in his publication of the pediments. The most frequent suggestion gives the head to Nike, charioteer of Athena in the West Pediment. The break of the neck, however, furnishes no clear join with any of the extant figures. In her publication of a roughly contemporary head from the Athenian Agora, Harrison notes that the upper eyelid overlaps the lower in the outer corner of the left eye, though not of the right eye. This treatment, together with the more careful rendering of the left ear and the hair on the left side of the face, leads her to believe that the head was designed to be seen in a three-quarter view from the proper left side and hence would come from the right half of the pediment, whether East or West. This would eliminate the attribution to Nike, Figure West G, as a possibility. The figure of Amphitrite on the East Pediment is a possibility. Brommer, on the other hand, believes the optimal view is essentially from the front and suggests more can be determined by the fault lines of the marble. However, the much heavier weathering on the left side of the face may not reflect its original position, but rather its later history, such as the period when it was built into a Venetian wall. Similarly, the depression on the back of the head may reflect some later vicissitude rather than an original reworking of the head. In any case, the theory once advanced by Sauer that it was cut to fit under the overhanging lip of the geison is probably not the correct explanation."
