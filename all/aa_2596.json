          "A definitive identification of the second female figure is hindered by the insufficient preservation of the accompanying inscription, to the point at which it is not clear whether it was an alliance or an honorary decree.  As Athena shakes hands with this female figure, it is most likely a treaty decree.  Lawton suggests that the scene is more appropriate to an alliance decree (there is no indication that the honorand was actually shown in the relief).  The text does, however, mention the honor that the Athenian Boule bestowed upon Dionysios, his brothers Leptines and Thearides, and brother-in-law Polyxenos.  U. Khler suggested that these honors were connected with  Dionysios' patronage of (Athenian) poets, at the beginning of brief rapprochement between Dionysios and Athens.  Dionysios was not given Athenian citizenship, nor contracted an alliance with Athens until the 360s, long after this stele was erected.  The identification of this female figure as a goddess is suggested by her scale, which is close to that of Athena; Lawton suggests that she is either Demeter holding grains or Persephone with her torch.  Particularly as this stele concerns Syracuse, however, it would not be surprising if she was a local personification.  Extrapolating from the coin evidence, which is particularly abundant with regard to the Syracusan mint, she could be identified as Syrakousa herself, Arethusa (the personification of the famous spring that served as a representative of the city on the remarkable dekadrachms), or Sikelia (the personification of the island, much of which Dionysios controlled by this time), as suggested by Khler."
