          "The relief crowns a document regarding the renewal of a treaty concerning the import of wheat into Athens, from the Bosporan kingdom, which had been an important source for grain, with friendly Athenian relations, since the second half of the fifth century.  The document promises that the sons of Leukon, surely the two men shown seated, will be crowned with 1000-drachmai gold crowns at each Greater Panathenaia; the same award is extended to their brother Apollonios, according to a rider added at a later date, which would explain why Apollonios is not represented on the relief.  Lawton (98) and other have assumed that the standing male figure is Apollonios.  This is highly unlikely, not only because he is mentioned in a rider, and not in the original document, but the standing figure is suggested to be larger and/or more important than the seated figures (whether or not his seated height would be greater than theirs, his head is much higher than theirs), which would be inappropriate for a younger brother.  Further, while the seated brothers are strongly characterized, with beards and long hair, as foreigners (akin to the male free-standing figures from the Mausoleion at Halikarnassos, as noted by Lawton [98]), the standing figure is not shown with long hair.  It is more likely that he represents a personification (relatively speaking, he is still too small to represent a god), rather than a mortal.  His clothing, and to some degree his stance, are comparable to those of the standing male figure (Demos?) on <rs type=\"sculpture\">Athens, NM 2986</rs>). Further, he is shown resting on a staff, which is a normal attribute for Demos."
