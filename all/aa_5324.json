On an amphoriskos by the Eretria\n      Painter, <rs type=\"vase\">Boston 00.355</rs>, Eros holds a small chest with four\n      white balls on top, which may be eggs or, as Lezzi-Hafter suggests, fruit; see\n      <bibl>Lezzi-Hafter 1988, 242, pl. 161)</bibl>.</P>"

          "<P>A youth wearing a himation and a white fillet is leaning on his\n      staff to the right. With his right hand he proffers a small white object. Facing him at right\n      is a woman in a chiton and himation, whose hair is tied in a chignon with a white fillet. With\n      her right hand she holds out a basket decorated with maeanders. On the ground between the two\n      figures is a small chest decorated with dots and, in the center of one side, a star. On top of\n      the chest is an egg in added white (not a knob, as Robinson suggested). The object held by the\n      youth may therefore also be an egg, but its top is flattened. The giving of eggs, symbols of\n      fertility and birth, had a significance beyond the merely culinary, as it still does in\n      Greece, where eggs are featured in many ceremonies, particularly at Easter. Eggs are common in\n      South Italian vase-painting, particularly Paestan. Robinson's suggestion that the objects may\n      be balls is improbable, as the objects played with by some women are actually balls of wool,\n      taken not from chests but from the kalathoi that are a nearly invariable feature of such\n      scenes; e.g. <rs type=\"vase\">New York 41.162.147</rs> (<bibl>ARV2, 733,\n      62</bibl>.</P><P>Above the figures, at the base of the neck, is a band of\n      tongues. The groundline is a band of egg pattern with dotted interstices. The side of the foot\n      is reserved, and there is a very narrow reserved stripe around the inner edge of the mouth.\n      The rest of the vase is black.</P>"
