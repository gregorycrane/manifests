As Isokrates notes (<bibl n=\"Isoc. 16.26\">Isoc. 16.26</bibl>), during the exile of the Alkmeonids after the Battle of Pallene (541-538 B.C.), the houses of the Alkmeonids were destroyed, and their graves were dug up.

The hair of the youth is neatly arranged in stylized curls over his brow and on the back of his neck (where they are slightly longer), with all curls emerging from beneath a narrow taenia.  His right arm, which is missing, probably fell to his side, while he holds a pomegranate between the forefingers of his (preserved) left hand, raised to the level of his chest.  An aryballos (small jar for oil), attached to a leather thong (as was usual for athletes, is attached to his left wrist.  The girl' shair is also bound by a taenia, beneath which it falls in long wavy locks.
