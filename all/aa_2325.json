          "Two children, three women, and a man are assembled around a seated woman, Leonike. (Richter asserts sensibly that the lekythos commemorates the daughter, Aristomache, however, as determined by the gestures of the other figures). The first figure, a girl, perhaps a servant, stands in 3/4-view to the right, with her weight on her left leg.  She wears a high-belted chiton, and short hair. She holds her right hand at her side, and a box in her bent left arm, at waist level. Ahead of her stands a woman, Stratokleia, shown in 3/4-view to the right, with her weight on her left leg. She wears a himation twisted around her waist, over a chiton. Her hair is gathered in a bun at the nape of her neck, while her hair is rolled to frame her face. In front of her is Leonike (probably Aristomache's mother), seated near profile to the right on a klismos, or backed chair. She too wears a himation draped over both shoulders and swathed around a chiton. Her left hand rests on her lap, while she raises her bent right arm slightly, to shake hands with Aristomache, who stands in front of her. Behind her stands a bearded man, Aiolos (probably Aristomache's father), 3/4-view to the right, although his face is shown in profile to the right. He wears a himation over his left shoulder. He holds both arms above waist level, and reaches his left hand to touch the arm of Aristomache. Opposite him stands Aristomache, whose body is shown 3/4-view to the left, with her head near profile to the left. Her hair is arranged similarly to that of the standing woman opposite her.  She too wears a himation over a chiton, although her himation is arranged diagonally across her upper chest, and falls over her left shoulder. Behind her stands another woman, Axiomache, shown frontally. Her clothing is arranged similarly to that of the first standing woman. She tilts her head slightly toward the central figures, holds her left hand to her cheek (in a mourning gesture), and rests her left elbow in her right hand. To her left (viewer's right) stands another small girl, perhaps a servant, 3/4-view to the left. She too wears an unbelted, long-sleeved chiton, grasps a box in her left arm, holds her right hand to her cheek (in a mourning gesture?), and tilts her head to look up at the woman next to her."
