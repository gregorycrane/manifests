          "The stele represents a battle scene, comprised of four warriors, of which three are extant.  The right (?) knee and left arm are all that is preserved of the first warrior, who seems to attack his enemy by seizing his hair at the nape of his neck. His antagonist is crouched in a kneeling posture 3/4-view to the left, with his head tilted down. He wears a belted chitoniskos and a pilos on his head, and holds his shield (shown in 3/4-view on the inside) on his left arm, above his left shoulder. He stretches his (upper) right arm to the left of the stele (now missing). Behind, and somewhat beneath him lies a wounded, nude, warrior, on an uneven surface. He is shown in a supine position, with his lower torso turned toward the viewer, his chest in a 3/4-view, turned slightly toward the top of the stele, and his head in 3/4-view, turned toward the bottom of the stele. He lies on some drapery, presumably his chlamys, which is fastened with a circular brooch at the front of his chest, and holds his left arm flat on the ground, his right arm bent over the top of his head (he still clutches a sword in his right hand). Behind him is a long-haired warrior, also dressed in a belted chitoniskos and a pilos, wearing a nebris, or animal pelt, over his left arm, fastened on his right shoulder. This warrior is shown in 3/4-view to the right, and runs, leading with his left leg. He holds his bent left arm ahead of his body, and his straighter right arm behind his body."
