          "<P>The interior of the bowl is surrounded by a black-glazed band\n      on the inside of the lip, with two thin reserved stripes at the rim and along the midsection\n      of the band. A ring of pomegranates with double petals faces inward just inside the band; the\n      ring is interrupted by figures that extend to the edge of their field.</P><P>In\n      the center scene, a young, bearded Bellerophon runs in Knielauf position to attack the\n      Chimaera, who rears up in front of him. Bellerophon is wearing a sleeveless chiton that\n      reaches to his knees and purple boots. The chiton has an incised diamond pattern, while its\n      belt and hem are black bands with double transverse incisions. With his right hand Bellerophon\n      thrusts his spear into the Chimaera's belly, while in his left he holds the reins of Pegasos,\n      rearing up behind him, forming a heraldic counterpart to the Chimaera. Pegasos is attacking\n      the Chimaera with his hooves. The horse's upper wing is purple, while the spreading feathers\n      are black. The tail is also purple, and simple purple lines cover the neck, belly and\n      hindquarters. The three-headed Chimaera is defending itself, turning back her lion's head to\n      avoid the blows of Pegasos's hooves that now hit her neck. She reaches with her forepaws\n      behind Pegasos's chest, having missed her target. The lion's head with open mouth and long\n      drooping tongue looks directly into the face of the Chimaera's second, goat head, which\n      emerges from her back. The goat's head is long-horned, bearded, and fire-breathing. The flames\n      are depicted by three lines emanating from her nostrils. The third head is at the end of the\n      tail that changes into a snake. With this snake head she reaches forward to the goat's horn\n      tips. The snake's head is in profile, and its body details are carefully incised. The body of\n      the monster is huge, with incised hair on the belly and wavy markings on the trunk (nine\n      incised alternating with seven purple lines). Two purple jets of blood spurt from the\n      monster's belly where Bellerophon's spear has entered. The eyes of Pegasos, Bellerophon and\n      the lion's head are incised, with curving upper and lower lines and a central open area for\n      the pupils, added on Pegasos. The goat and snake heads have simple circles for eyes.\n      Bellerophon's knees, elbows, and ear are also incised.</P><P>On the exterior the\n      main decoration appears in three ornamental friezes encircling the bowl's underside. The\n      lowest frieze consists of a row of pomegranates with double petals; the next is a band of\n      upright, alternately black and purple tongues, and the top is a line of broad upright rays.\n      The pomegranates are separated from the foot attachment by four concentric black bands. The\n      three friezes are each separated by a wide purple band between three brown lines. Above the\n      top frieze a group of bands provides the lower boundary to the handle zone. In the handle zone\n      are four handle-palmettes. The lip jog is marked by a thin line, while the lip itself is plain\n      but for a pair of thin lines below a thick band at the rim. Over the whole exterior of the cup\n      is a creamy slip. The foot is black glazed on interior and exterior with a plain resting\n      surface. The bowl join has a fillet covered by a slip.</P>"
