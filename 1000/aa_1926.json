The nature of the break at the neck suggests the statue was intentionally decapitated, but this need not have been the work of the Persians. The relatively fresh surface had led most scholars to postulate a date in the 480s, damage by the Persians and eventual burial along with much other sculpture before the Periklean rebuilding program, but see Hurwit 1989 for full discussion of the various possibilities. Raubitschek has suggested a possible connection with an inscribed column and capital, but the link is uncertain, as is the date of the column itself.</P>"

          "<P>Statue of young man. Frontal pose, weight on left leg, right leg slightly forward, with corresponding reflections throughout rest of body. Head tilted to his right and slightly down. Though a descendant of the kouros type, this statue has been thought to represent a victor. The recent identification as a hero, perhaps Theseus, is based largely on the tubular ring around which his hair is wound, since other known examples seem to be worn by gods rather than athletes, for whom a flat fillet is more appropriate. However, the nature of dedications on the Acropolis in this period  itself uncertain  is still not well understood.</P><P>Known as the Kritios Boy because of his resemblance to the famous statue of Harmodios in the group of the Tyrannicides (known through copies and molds) by the sculptor Kritios, which was erected after 480 to replace the sculpture carried off by the Persians. He is perhaps the earliest extant male statue in fully developed Early Classical style and, as such, his date is much debated. The principal argument is concerned with whether he was made before or after the Persian sack of the Acropolis."
