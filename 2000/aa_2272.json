Ionic columns, in a four by six arrangement (with four each on the front and back) support an architrave decorated with a carved frieze, with dentils above, and finally a pediment (with relief sculpture in the gables).</P><P>The actual tomb chamber (like a cella) was located within the colonnade, with porches before and behind it.

          "<P>The name of the Nereid Tomb comes from the free-standing statues of draped females placed between the columns of the tomb (see <rs type=\"sculpture\">London 909</rs>; <rs type=\"sculpture\">London 910</rs>; <rs type=\"sculpture\">London 912</rs>).  Their position between the columns is indicated by the setting marks on the stylobate, between the columns.  These figures were once thought to have been victories (an identification that has been largely rejected because none of the figures were winged, and victories, or Nikai, are almost always winged in Greek art.  Their identification as Nereids, or daughters of Nereus, the \"old man of the sea,\" is more likely as they are shown to have been running over water; this is indicated by sea creatures beneath their feet, as well as waves.  This iconography might also be appropriate for an identification as Aurai, or the personification of Breezes.</P><P>Many friezes also decorate the architectural structure that comprises the tomb.  The lowest frieze (on the podium) shows a battle between Greeks and barbarians (<rs type=\"sculpture\">London 850-865</rs>); the (smaller) upper frieze shows another battle, with the siege of a walled city (<rs type=\"sculpture\">London 866-85</rs>).</P><P>The architrave frieze  (<rs type=\"sculpture\">London 885-897</rs>) shows a variety of scenes perhaps illustrating activities of the aristocrats buried in the tomb.</P><P>The interior frieze (<rs type=\"sculpture\">London 898-905</rs>) shows sacrifice and banquet scenes.</P><P>Relief sculpture also occupied the pedimental space within the triangular gables on the front (east) and back (west) of the roof--<rs type=\"sculpture\">London 924</rs> and <rs type=\"sculpture\">London 925</rs> respectively. The pediments were also surmounted by sculpture groups, each of which represented a nude youth holding a female figure (<rs type=\"sculpture\">London 926</rs> and <rs type=\"sculpture\">London 927</rs>).  The original location of two lions (London 929 and London 930), which seem to have been associated with the tomb, is unknown.</P>"
