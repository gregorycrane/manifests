          "<P>A bearded male figure, perhaps Demos, seated 3/4-view to the right, on a rock that blends with the left anta, wearing a himation draped over his hips and legs, and a taenia or wreath (missing, probably a metal attachment) in his hair, holds his right hand at his side, and his left hand on his left thigh; a female figure, perhaps Korkyra, standing frontal, with her weight on her left leg, her head turned in 3/4-view to left, inclined slightly down, wearing a belted peplos and a himation veiled over her head, holds her right hand up to her veil in a gesture of anakalypsis, and rests her left hand (obscured by drapery) on her hip; Athena, standing 3/4-view to the left, with her weight on her right leg, her head profile to the left, inclined slightly down, wearing a himation draped diagonally over a chiton, and a Corinthian helmet, lowers her right hand (to a painted shield?), and raises her left hand to a (painted?) spear. <P>If the female figure is a personification, she would most likely be Korkyra, although this is not certain.  Lawton (127) strongly argues for her identification as Hera Akraia, the goddess with the most important cult at Korkyra (mentioned in <bibl n=\"Thuc. 1.24\">Thuc. 1.24</bibl>; <bibl n=\"Thuc. 3.75\">Thuc. 3.75</bibl>; <bibl n=\"Thuc. 79-81\">Thuc. 79-81</bibl> and <bibl n=\"Diod. 12.48\">Diod. 12.48</bibl>).  On parallel, the male figure would then be identified as Zeus (as on <rs type=\"sculpture\">Athens, NM 1481</rs>).  Such an interpretation is consistent with his regal appearance on this relief, although the lack of attributes hinders a sure identification.  It is doubtful that he represents Demos, particularly as his himation is only draped about his waist, rather than over the left shoulder or arm, as befits Demos.  In this regard, this male figure is more akin to the seated male figures on the treasury decrees (e.g. <rs type=\"sculpture\">Athens, EM 7859</rs>), who are now taken to be heroes rather than Demoi, for which reason he has been identified as Kekrops (see <hi rend=\"ital\"><bibl>LIMC</bibl></hi>).</P>"
