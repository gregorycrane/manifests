          "The long-time association of this relief with Athens, EM 7166 (formerly Athens, NM II 172), a list of two men from each phyle involved in a liturgy called the Eutaxia is not certain, as none of the extant fragments join.  It is likely, however, and if so, the relief must have predated 317/6, when Demetrios of Phaleron abolished festival liturgies.  If the association is correct, then Eutaxia personifies the military/gymnasium discipline associated with the ephebes, as suggested by Palagia (<hi rend=\"ital\">ibid.</hi>), and this relief must have commemorated a festival event involving contestants.  In <hi rend=\"ital\"><bibl>LIMC</bibl></hi> 4 (1988) 120 s.v. Eutaxia no. 1, Palagia adds that Eutaxia (\"good order\") was a prominent quality of the ephebes, for which they were praised in Attic inscriptions from the 330s to Roman period. Ute Kron (<bibl>Kron 1976</bibl>, 237-38, 289) argues that the male figure is a phyle hero, because eutaxia was a phyle responsibility; whereas Lawton (146) argues for his identification as Demos, because liturgists for all of the phylai are listed.  The smaller figure presumably stands in place of all the victors being honored by Demos and Eutaxia (for another example of a single figure standing in place of many, see <bibl>Lawton 1995</bibl>, no. 97)."
