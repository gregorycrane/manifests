          "<P>The neck is glazed on the inside and outside; there are four\n      painted lines around the inside of the neck. The glazed, overhanging torus-shaped rim has an\n      upper edge raised slightly above the mouth; the underside is reserved. The shoulder panel is\n      reserved between the centers of the near ends of the side handles, and is framed laterally by\n      single painted lines and below by a dilute glaze groundline. Indications of a second\n      groundline above the existing one remain on the ends of the panel above the handles. The body\n      panel is reserved between the near ends of the side handles, enclosed on the sides by ivy\n      vines set between double lines. The large leaves are connected to the branch by curved stems,\n      with triple berry clusters and single berries in the interstices. At the bottom of the panel\n      is a dilute glaze groundline. There are reserved patches beneath the side handles. Two painted\n      bands encircle the vase below the body panel and another runs above the 28 base rays. There is\n      a painted line around the center of the echinus foot. The vertical handle, which is round in\n      cross-section, widens at the top to form rotellae at the junctions with the rim. Near the\n      bottom of the handle is a single mock rivet. The side handles, also round in cross-section,\n      are glazed on the outside and reserved within.</P><P>On the shoulder are three\n      youths conversing. A naked man stands to the right between two others who are dressed in long\n      himatia. The robe of the youth on the left is decorated with rosettes. Two mounted youths clad\n      in short chitons flank the group, each followed by a flying bird. The hair of the nude youth\n      and the rider on the right is painted red. Also red are the chitons of both riders, the\n      himation of the youth on the right, the centers of the rosettes The rosettes themselves are\n      white) and the lining of the himation of the youth on the left, and the wing-bars of the\n      right-hand bird.</P><P>On the body of the vase is a quadriga to the right. A\n      warrior stands in the chariot on the far side of the charioteer (Achilles or Automedon?). He\n      is half hidden, and wears a short tunic, corselet, greaves, and a low-crested helmet. In his\n      left hand he carries a shield and two spears; with his right he grasps the chariot rail. The\n      interior of his shield and the lower part of the chariot are painted red. The charioteer wears\n      a belted nebris over a long chiton, which is painted white. He holds the reins with both hands\n      and a goad with his right. The horses' forelocks are tied up in topknots. Some of their\n      harnesses are painted red. In the upper field at the center is the inscription <foreign\n      lang=\"Greek\">*K*A*L*E *K*O*L*O*U*R*A</foreign> (\"Koloura is\n      beautiful\").</P>"
